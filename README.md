### Work Experience
Data Scientist @ EY

● Implemented advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automate the identification and classification
of information, facilitating data analysis, data modeling, sentiment analysis and insights generation.
● Orchestrated efficient ETL workflows with ADF for seamless data movement and transformation, while optimizing
storage and retrieval using Blob Storage.
● Used advanced statistical analysis to discover patterns and insights in large datasets, guiding data-driven decisions and
significantly enhancing the outcomes of strategic projects.
● Created interactive Tableau dashboards and reports to present the results of machine learning models and data
analyses effectively to non-technical stakeholders.
● Developed Tableau data source connections to various databases, including Snowflake and PostgreSQL, ensuring
real-time data updates of data visualization in dashboards.
● Engaged in backend development using Python and Java architecting server-side logic, APIs, and databases (PostgreSQL
and Elasticsearch) to support application functionality.
● Utilized Elasticsearch-NoSQL for ROT (Redundant, Obsolete, Trivial) analysis, data analysis, ingestion, and exploratory
data analysis (EDA) for various industries such as E-commerce, Health, and Finance.
Leveraged AWS SageMaker to develop and deploy machine learning models for real-time data processing and
prediction in a streaming data environment.
● Implemented end-to-end data streaming pipelines using AWS Kinesis to ingest, process, and analyze large volumes of
streaming data.
● Developed and implemented machine learning models on large data sets using Databricks, and Pyspark for client’s
companies, focusing on data governance leveraging S3 as the data source.
● Utilized in-depth analysis and insights from metrics, reports, and analysis to drive key business decisions, resulting in
improved operational efficiency, cost savings, and revenue growth.
● Developed ml models to identify and classify data leakage risks, providing dynamic prevention measures and minimizing
potential data breaches using Snowflake data warehouse.
● Developed and optimized complex SQL queries and stored procedures to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from
diverse sources into the data warehouse.
● Enhanced ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes by identifying performance bottlenecks, optimizing data
transformation algorithms, and leveraging parallel processing techniques, resulting in a significant reduction in data
processing time.
● Designed and orchestrated a pipeline leveraging AWS Glue, Lambda, S3, Step Functions, SNS, Appflow and Redshift.
Engineered a data processing pipeline for the ingestion and transformation of email PST files into Elasticsearch,
harnessing NLP techniques and NoSQL storage measures to handle emails containing sensitive information.
● Developed a Microsoft PowerApps solution to streamline task management for EY users, seamlessly integrating it with
Power BI to provide a comprehensive consolidated overview.
